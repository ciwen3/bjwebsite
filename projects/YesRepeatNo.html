<h1>
  Yes Repeat No
</h1>

<p>
  Three actors audition to play the Palestinian-Jewish actor and activist, Juliano Mer-Khamis, a former IDF paratrooper who defiantly identified as “100% Palestinian and 100% Jewish.” During a tense rehearsal meant to determine which of them is most suited to authentically portray Juliano Mer-Khamis, the three Julianos find their sense-of-self fractured and disrupted.
</p>

<p>
  Assassinated on the steps of the theatre he founded in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis considered himself a living embodiment of the Palestine-Israel conflict. Though switching between the conflicting identities he inhabited, he was always viewed as an Arab in Israel, and a Jew in Jenin. YES REPEAT NO asks whether it is remembering our past--or, instead, forgetting it— that allows us to break cycles of identity and conflict.
